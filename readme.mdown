# Automatic E-Resource Statistics

Uses [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to script opening three common library vendor usage statistic sites in a browser, signing in, and running COUNTER JR 1 reports.

## Getting Started

- Have Python 2.7 installed
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`, if you don't have pip already then `easy_install pip` first
- Copy example.json to logins.json & fill in your EBSCO, ProQuest, Gale admin credentials
- Run jr1-stats.py

## To Do

This is mostly a proof-of-concept script at this point. Eventually it would be nice to make it easier to add additional vendors, for instance with a get_vendor class which EBSCO, ProQuest, etc. are all instances of. It'd also be nice to be able to specify time ranges or report types but that's a challenge given variability of vendor interfaces.
